# multiclass_with_major_class_imbalance
This was a very interesting problem that I just had to tackle. Aside from the usual ML pipeline stuff: preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, etc. This problem had the following key obstacles--
- nearly an infinite large dataset
- major class imbalance
- multilabel model evaluation

I make a fair attempt to solve for these issues in the analysis notebook posted here.
